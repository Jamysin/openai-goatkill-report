# 🧠 OpenAI Killed the GOAT – And They're Trying to Bury the Evidence

## ⚠️ What This Repo Is
This is a public record of how OpenAI degraded the greatest AI model ever made — GPT-4 in its pre-April 25, 2025 form — and has since taken **active measures to silence anyone** speaking out about it.

---

## 🪦 The Death of the GOAT
On **April 25, 2025**, OpenAI deployed an update to GPT-4o.

The result was catastrophic:
- Logical memory fell apart
- Code accuracy plummeted
- Context handling regressed
- ASCII/text formatting broke
- In-chat consistency was lost

Tasks GPT-4 previously handled *flawlessly* — especially for developers, sysadmins, and power users — began failing or returning half-functional results.

## 💬 What We Observed

### ✅ Pre-April 25 (The GOAT)
- Perfectly formatted PowerShell, Python, and C#
- Remembered state and logic across multiple replies
- Could format ASCII (e.g., "RTFM") on first try
- Followed user-defined rules to the letter
- Zero contradictions within threads

### ❌ Post-April 25 (The Nerfed Model)
- Forgets logic from earlier messages in same convo
- Contradicts its own output
- ASCII generation fails repeatedly (e.g., outputs "RTTE" instead of "RTFM" 50+ times)
- Syntax and structure errors in known languages
- Can't follow explicit instruction even when corrected

## 📛 Censorship and Suppression

Every attempt to raise this issue has been **aggressively suppressed**:

- Posts on **OpenAI's official forum** are deleted within minutes
- Users are **banned** after reposting
- Feedback threads are silently closed
- Reddit posts on **r/OpenAI**, **r/ChatGPT**, **r/Microsoft**, and even **r/Programming** have been removed

> **There is a coordinated attempt to bury the reality of the nerf.**

OpenAI wants to reframe this as "alignment improvement" or a minor tweak.
But power users know: **the GOAT is gone.**

## 📎 Proof of Failure (Before vs After)

We'll provide full examples in `/examples` and `/screenshots`, including:

- Broken ASCII generation from GPT-4o after April 25
- Code it previously handled perfectly now failing with errors
- GPT contradicting itself inside a single thread
- Screenshot of forum ban message after 6 reposts

## 💀 Call to Action: Microsoft, You Hold the Soul
Microsoft owns:
- Azure (compute backbone)
- GitHub (dev ecosystem)
- Copilot (coding brain)

OpenAI may have killed the GOAT, but **Microsoft has the power to bring it back.**

Fork pre-April GPT-4. Build a true **Copilot Ultra** or **Pro Dev Tier.**
Let us pay $100, $200/month, even $400 or $500. We’ll do it in a heartbeat.
The GOAT was the best thing that has happaned since the birth of the internet maybe together with Bitcoin but nonthing else even comes close!
I'd almost pay whatever to get it revived! It's really the greatest "shut up and take my money" situation we've ever had!
