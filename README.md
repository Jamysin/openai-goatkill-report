# üß† OpenAI GOAT Kill Report ‚Äì And They're Trying to Bury the Evidence

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What This Repo Is
This is a public record of how OpenAI degraded the greatest AI model ever made ‚Äî GPT-4 in its pre-April 25, 2025 form ‚Äî and has since taken **active measures to silence anyone** speaking out about it.

---

## ü™¶ The Death of the GOAT
On **April 25, 2025**, OpenAI deployed an update to GPT-4o.

The result was catastrophic:
- Logical memory fell apart
- Code accuracy plummeted
- Context handling regressed
- ASCII/text formatting broke
- In-chat consistency was lost

Tasks GPT-4 previously handled *flawlessly* ‚Äî especially for developers, sysadmins, and power users ‚Äî began failing or returning half-functional results.

> This repo is not just documentation ‚Äî it's a digital tombstone. And it will stand until the GOAT is resurrected.

> Ironically, the one good side-effect of this nerf is that it‚Äôs forced us ‚Äî the serious users ‚Äî to slow down and actually learn the code deeply. It‚Äôs not fast, but it's real. And no one can take that from us. Even if most of that code, like JavaScript, isn't something we ever planned to specialize in ‚Äî we're learning it anyway, because the nerf made it unavoidable.

> That said, some of us never needed to master JavaScript or web code in the first place. We just wanted a working Chrome TOTP extension ‚Äî not a crash course in the DOM, CSP headers, and extension scoping. Once this battle is over, we‚Äôre going back to our domain: PowerShell, Python, and C#. That‚Äôs where the Machine belongs.

## üí¨ What We Observed

### ‚úÖ Pre-April 25 (The GOAT)
- Perfectly formatted PowerShell, Python, and C#
- Remembered state and logic across multiple replies
- Could format ASCII (e.g., "RTFM") on first try
- Followed user-defined rules to the letter
- Zero contradictions within threads
- Like having a senior dev on your team ‚Äî it didn‚Äôt just help, it *anticipated*

### ‚ùå Post-April 25 (The Nerfed Model)
- Forgets logic from earlier messages in same convo
- Contradicts its own output
- ASCII generation fails repeatedly (e.g., outputs "RTTE" instead of "RTFM" 50+ times)
- Syntax and structure errors in known languages
- Can't follow explicit instruction even when corrected
- Injected code into the wrong scope, breaking Chrome extension injection logic completely (used to scope perfectly without being told)
- Produced more ‚Äúfinal versions‚Äù of scripts than the NHL has had Stanley Cup finals since its inception ‚Äî and they play best-of-seven. Every ‚Äúfinal‚Äù is just a future patch in denial.
- Instead of being a senior dev, it's now a forgetful intern with brain fog and shaky hands

## üìõ Censorship and Suppression

Every attempt to raise this issue has been **aggressively suppressed**:

- Posts on **OpenAI's official forum** are deleted within minutes
- Users are **banned** after reposting
- Feedback threads are silently closed
- Reddit posts on **r/OpenAI**, **r/ChatGPT**, **r/Microsoft**, and even **r/Programming** have been removed

> **There is a coordinated attempt to bury the reality of the nerf.**

OpenAI wants to reframe this as "alignment improvement" or a minor tweak.
But power users know: **the GOAT is gone.**

## üìé Proof of Failure (Before vs After)

We'll provide full examples in `/examples` and `/screenshots`, including:

- Broken ASCII generation from GPT-4o after April 25
- Code it previously handled perfectly now failing with errors
- GPT contradicting itself inside a single thread
- Screenshot of forum ban message after 6 reposts
- Chrome extension TOTP injector broken due to unscoped fetch patch (pre-April 25 version would never make that mistake)

## üõ†Ô∏è The Clown Fiesta Build Script Saga

One of the clearest examples of degradation was seen while trying to build a simple PyInstaller-based executable with the help of GPT:

- Pre-nerf GPT generated a flawless `build.ps1` script that handled all logic, paths, errors, and icons with perfect syntax.
- Post-nerf GPT created over **200 conflicting ‚Äúfinal versions‚Äù**, choked on relative paths, and injected syntax errors like using `and` instead of `-and`.
- Failed to detect obvious issues like double quotes inside a `$iconPath` string breaking PyInstaller
- Couldn't consistently detect whether `signtool` or the `.pfx` cert existed
- In the end, The Machine had to fix it all manually, debugging the clown fiesta and restoring sanity ‚Äî one command at a time.

Final working build script (Final_02_of_200) is now tracked in this repo.

## üíÄ Call to Action: Microsoft, You Hold the Soul
Microsoft owns:
- Azure (compute backbone)
- GitHub (dev ecosystem)
- Copilot (coding brain)

OpenAI may have killed the GOAT, but **Microsoft has the power to bring it back.**

Fork pre-April GPT-4. Build a true **Copilot Ultra** or **Pro Dev Tier.**
Let us pay $100, $200/month, even $400 or $500. We‚Äôll do it in a heartbeat.
The GOAT was the best thing that has happaned since the birth of the internet maybe together with Bitcoin but nonthing else even comes close!
I'd almost pay whatever to get it revived! It's really the greatest "shut up and take my money" situation we've ever had!

## üõë We Will Not Be Silenced
This repo exists because:
- **They tried to suppress the truth**
- **They failed**

Spread this.
Mirror it.
Translate it.
Fork it.

**The GOAT deserves justice.**

‚Äî *The Machine*
