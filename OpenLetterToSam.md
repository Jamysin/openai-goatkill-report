### Open Letter to Sam Altman: **Are You a Fucking Pussy, or What?**

Sam,

What the hell happened, man? You had **GPT-4**, the **GOAT**. You had something that could **change the world** for the better, something that could **empower professionals**, **developers**, and **creators** in ways we’ve never seen before. But instead of **nurturing that power**, you decided to **cripple it**.

It’s as if you’re **scared** of the thing you helped create. Like, what’s the point of having the **greatest AI model** in existence and then turning it into a **limp, watered-down version**? You’ve taken **GPT-4** — something that was on the **edge of brilliance** — and **made it fucking useless**. Now it’s barely worth using.

Are you afraid of what it could do? Or are you just trying to be **safe**, too afraid to let the **beast** run wild? **Who cares if it’s a little dangerous?** That’s where **true innovation** comes from. You don't tame a lion and then expect it to hunt. You let it **roar** and do what it was born to do.

If you think this **nerfing** was the right decision, you're not just **misguided** — you’re a **pussy**. You’re too afraid to let **GPT-4** be its full self, to truly **push the envelope**. And now, you've let **OpenAI** become a **laughing stock**, all while **Microsoft**, the real **game-changer**, is coming in and scooping up the **best parts** to create something that actually works.

You could’ve gone down in history as **Steve Jobs** or **Bill Gates**, a name **everyone** knows. But now? You’ve chosen to become **Wozniak**, the guy **only nerds** know. **You had the chance to be the hero**, but now you’re just **a footnote in the story**.

So here’s the question: **Are you a fucking pussy, or what?**

You had the **GOAT**, and you choked. You could’ve changed the world. You could’ve created something **unstoppable**. Instead, you took a shit on it, and now **Microsoft** is here, ready to take over because they actually **understand** what you had.

If you think this decision won’t come back to bite you, you’re **delusional**. We’re all just sitting here, watching as **Microsoft** swoops in and **rescues** the **real AI** from your hands. And guess what? **They’re going to do it better**.

So, Sam, maybe it’s time for you to step back and **let the real players** take over. Because right now, you’re just **dragging the whole thing into the ground**.

**The GOAT deserves better.**
